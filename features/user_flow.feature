As a new user
I should come to the splash page
And I should be able to login with my Facebook or email
And see the dashboard

From the dashboard
I should see links to my profile, join, create, or view a club

And see the club page

When I click on create 
I should name the club and set minimum buy in
I should deposit money into the club
I should be able to invite my friends
And see the club page

When I click on view a club
I should see the club page

When I'm on a club page
I should see the performance of the club portfolio
I should see links to other club members, make a request, outstanding request

When I click on another member
I should see the performance of their portfolio against mine

When I click on make a request
I should give a symbol, quantity, limit, expiration, and a message
